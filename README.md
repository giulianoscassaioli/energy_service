## Introduction and Technologies stack
This is a CRM application to manage Clients and their Invoces.
Every User registered can Login or can SignUp if they are new to the service,
then they can view the list of all the Clients
and their invoces and have different ways of looking for them within the application.
Loging in with the Username "admin" and password "admin" gives the User extra-privileges
such us deleting a client or an invoice, updating them or saving new ones in the system.

### Tech stack: 
- Java + Spring Boot
- Authentication through Jason Web Token for the API RESTfull service
- Authentication for the Web Service (including Login and Signup)
- Secure storage of the password using encryption
- Support of Pagination
- Auto-calculation of Clients total income based on their Invoces
- JUnit
- Swagger Documentation
- Eclipse
- Postgress DBMS
- Thymeleaf for the Web Service (Front-End)
- Advanced REST Client
- Maven
- Git and Gihub, of course : )

## Input / Output

For the submission of a this app I decided to implement a REST interface for sending data. The output of the service will be the printing of the Client.

SIGN-UP

You can use The Rest service with Post Man.
You can Sign-Up to the application at the link https://customers-management-service.herokuapp.com/auth/signup
sending in the Body of the POST Request a Json like this:

```
{
  "username": "yourUsername",
  "email": "yourUsername",
  "role": [
    "user"
  ],
  "password": "yourPassword",
  "nome": "yourName",
  "cognome": "yourSurname"
}

```
You can also choose your role if you make an admin account you will have extra-priveleges.

LOGIN

If you want to login now using your credentials simply make a post request to https://customers-management-service.herokuapp.com/auth/login
sending in the Body of the Request a Json like this:

```
 {
  "userName": "yourUsername",
  "password": "yourPassword"
}
```
You will have a response status code 200 and a response Bearer-Token to keep
in order to have permission of using any function of this application by putting it
into the headers section before making any request.
From now on in your Headers section of any request choose in the field KEY->Authorization
and in The field VALUE write Bearer then a space and the the token you received in your login response.

SAVE A CLIENT

and different Json.

Specifing an existing "ragioneSociale" previuosly saved in the system.


You can delete an invoice sendig a DELETE Request at the end-point
URL: https://customers-management-service.herokuapp.com/api/eliminafattura/{}

just replace the {} with the invoice's
id numeber you wish to delete.

To view all the list of the invoices simply send a GET request at
URL: https://customers-management-service.herokuapp.com/api/allfatture

The application has many more functions as well!

For having a list of all the functions of my Rest API Email me at giulgab87@gmail.com.

## Testing

For the test I used Junit, testing all the critical modules of the system, both with unit tests on low level components and with black box tests of high level.
